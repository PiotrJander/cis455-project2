Which features did you implement? 
  Entire assignment, except I didn't do the unit tests.

Did you complete any extra-credit tasks? If so, which ones?
  No.

Any special instructions for building and running your solution?
  I have Jetty embedded in the app. Use "ant embedded-jetty" to start the servlet app.
  Of course, "ant servlet" works too, and copies the war file to Jetty's directory, hardcoded to /usr/share/jetty/webapps/.

  [x] Yes
  [ ] No
