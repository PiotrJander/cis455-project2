Which features did you implement? 
  My crawler uses Stormlite.
  I didn't complete the xpath engine. I only did tokenization of the xpath, as demonstrated in a unit test.
  Because of lack of XPath engine, I didn't implement a bolt which matches documents against channel.
  However, I did add logic to the database which would allow to store channels add associate them with users,
  again, as evident from unit tests.
  I added all required Servlet endpoints, but due to the lack of channels logic, some of them have dummy implementations.

Did you complete any extra-credit tasks? If so, which ones?
  No.

Any special instructions for building and running your solution?
  I have Jetty embedded in the app. Use "ant embedded-jetty" to start the servlet app.
  Of course, "ant servlet" works too, and copies the war file to Jetty's directory, hardcoded to /usr/share/jetty/webapps/.

Did you personally write _all_ the code you are submitting
(other than code from the course web page)?
  [x] Yes
  [ ] No

Did you copy any code from the Internet, or from classmates?
  [ ] Yes
  [x] No

Did you collaborate with anyone on this assignment?
